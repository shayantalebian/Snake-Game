# Snake Game

## ![Game Preview](./preview.png)

A classic remake of the legendary Snake game, one of the most iconic and widely played games from the era of Nokia phones.

## How it works

Use the arrow keys to control the snake as it moves across the screen, consuming food to grow longer. Avoid crashing into the walls or yourselfâ€”survive as long as possible to achieve the highest score!

**ðŸ”¥ The goal? Rack up the highest score possible!**

**âš¡ Warning: Highly Addictive!**

## More About this project

This project was created to apply Python skills in a real-world scenario by building an intermediate-level game. The idea originated from one of the projects in my [Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), serving as a fun and practical coding challenge.
